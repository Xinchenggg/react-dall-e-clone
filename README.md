# react-dall-e-clone

## Intro
This is a practice of making a clone web application of DALL-E with MERN stack.



By default configuration, the application will generate `1` image in `b64_json` format, with resolution of `256x256`, the other accepted size are `512x512` and `1024x1024`. You can change it in `\server\routes\dalleRoutes.js`

Note that each OpenAi account has $18 free trial usage, more generated image and larger size will cost more credit.

Besides, have fun!ðŸ˜œ
